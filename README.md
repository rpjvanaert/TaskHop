# TaskHop
An in development app by Ralf van Aert about how to spend your charge! Easily make and remove tasks in this app.

## Development update
Currently I'm bussy doing college, but whenever I find time and charge to work, I will!
Things I want to add to this app are:
- Google Drive sync
- Addition of sub-tasks
- Priorities (form of scaling or binair)
- Theming/Filtering tasks
